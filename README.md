Welcome to **Cubic 2048**, a 3D twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game. Instead of a flat grid, you'll be dropping numbered cubes into a container, where they stack and merge based on physics. Combine cubes with the same number to create a bigger cube and aim for the elusive 2048 cube!

## 🌟 Features

- **3D Gameplay:** A fresh take on the 2048 concept in a three-dimensional space.
- **Physics-Based Merging:** Cubes don't just slide; they fall, tumble, and stack, adding a new layer of strategy.
- **Simple Controls:** Easy to learn, but challenging to master.
- **Engaging Strategy:** Plan your drops carefully to set up chain reactions and avoid filling up the container.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Drop Cubes:** A numbered cube will appear at the top. Move it left or right and release to drop it into the play area.
2.  **Merge Cubes:** When two cubes with the same number touch, they merge into a single cube with double the value (e.g., two '4' cubes become an '8' cube). [1]
3.  **Aim for 2048:** Continue merging cubes to create higher numbers. The ultimate goal is to create the 2048 cube.
4.  **Game Over:** The game ends if the cubes stack up and cross the line at the top of the container. [1]
