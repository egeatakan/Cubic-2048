# Project Brief: Cubic 2048

This project is to create a web-based, 3D version of the game 2048. The game will be played on a cubic grid. The core mechanic involves merging cubes with the same number to create a cube with double the value, with the ultimate goal of reaching 2048.

The initial version will be a web application, but it should be designed with the potential for future expansion into a mobile application.
