# Product Context

This project aims to provide a fresh and engaging take on the classic 2048 game by introducing a third dimension. The problem it solves is the lack of innovation in the 2048 genre, offering a more challenging and visually interesting experience.

The game should be intuitive to play, with simple controls for rotating the cube and swiping to merge the smaller cubes. The user experience should be smooth and satisfying, with clear visual feedback for merges and game state changes.
